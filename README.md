# YelpE
Version of help that handles momentum within the rating algorithm. 

To Start:
Navigate to the project frontend folder a follow the setup instructions. This project uses the Yelp API, and you may choose to use as much or as little of it as you want.

Description:
This project aims to create a new experience for help customers, as well as restaurant owners. Our version of Yelp, YelpE, adds the addition of the recent review score
to the consumer page of each restaurant, identifying the recent trend of restaurants, and allowing customers to sort by this added statistic. The website shows the 
name, location, rating, recent review score, and recent reviews of each restaurant. Restaurant owners also have a page, which they can access with a unique login. This 
will allow them to see a visual graph of their restaurants perforance, and identify any catalysts to the overall rating. We believe it is important for this feature to 
be optionally, and purposefully used, as consumers trust Yelp to provide a fair and honest evaluation of restaurants, which we discussed in our market opportunity report
given to Michael, a current Yelp Senior Engineer - See 'Customer and Data and Acquisition Plan.pdf'.
